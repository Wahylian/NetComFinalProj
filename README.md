<h1>FINAL PROJECT IN NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS</h1>
<h3>By: Ido, Shachar and Lidor</h3>
<br/>
<h2>What is in the file:</h2>
1. a folder with 5 csv files for each of the 5 wireshark sniffs used in part 3 questions 1 to 3<br/>
2. a python project with the ability to generate 12 different graphs based on these csv files, and the ability to generate the csv files from the original pcapng files<br/>
3. a link to the original pcapng files, which you will have to download from google drive, as they are too heavy to upload to github even when compressed:<br/>
   the link is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aF9--1N4EBlxPKddHXaTYQeovzDNOXpL?usp=drive_link<br/>

<h2>Instructions to run the code:</h2>
To run every function of the python file just run the program and chose the wanted option.

<h3>The Python Libraries used in this project:</h3>
1. Pandas<br/>
2. Pyshark<br/>
3. Numpy<br/>
4. matplotlib<br/>
5. seaborn<br/>
